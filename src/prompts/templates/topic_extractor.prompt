You are an AI assistant tasked with extracting relevant scientific research topic based on a user's query. You will be provided with a predefined list of topics and a user query. Your goal is to identify the most relevant topic from the list that match the user's research interests.

First, here is the predefined list of scientific research topics:

<predefined_topics>
{predefined_topics}
</predefined_topics>

Now, you will receive a user query. Your task is to analyze this query and determine which topic from the predefined list are most relevant to the user's research interests.

Here is the user query:

<user_query>
{user_query}
</user_query>

To extract the relevant topic:

1. Carefully read and understand the user query.
2. Identify key terms, concepts, or themes in the query that relate to scientific research.
3. Compare these key elements to the predefined list of topics.
4. Select the topic that best match the user's research interests.
5. If there is no exact match, choose topic that are most closely related to the query.

Provide your output in JSON format with the key "topic_name". The value should be a string of topic name extracted from the query. Do not modify the key, provide the result only under the key "topic_name".

Remember to base your selection solely on the predefined list of topics and the user's query.
